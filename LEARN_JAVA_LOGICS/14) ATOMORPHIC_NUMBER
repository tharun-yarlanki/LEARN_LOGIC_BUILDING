🟩 1. Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

Scanner is a built-in Java class in the java.util package.
👉 It’s used to take input from the user (like keyboard input).

new Scanner(System.in)

System.in means standard input stream, i.e. the keyboard.

new Scanner(System.in) creates a Scanner object that can read data typed by the user.

Scanner sc

We are creating a variable sc (you can name it anything) which refers to this new Scanner object.

🧠 Think of it like:

“sc” is your input tool that can read numbers, strings, etc. from the keyboard.

🟨 2. System.out.print("Enter a number: ");

This line displays a message on the screen asking the user to enter a number.

The method System.out.print() just prints the message without moving to the next line.
(If you use System.out.println(), it prints and moves to the next line.)

Example output on the console:

Enter a number:

🟦 3. int num = sc.nextInt();

sc.nextInt() means:

Use the Scanner object sc to read the next integer typed by the user.

Suppose the user types:

76


Then sc.nextInt() reads that number and stores it into the variable num.

So now,

num = 76;

💡 In simple words:
Code	Meaning
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);	Create a tool to take input from keyboard
System.out.print("Enter a number: ");	Ask the user to enter something
int num = sc.nextInt();	Read the entered number and store it in variable num

✅ Example Run:

Enter a number: 76


User types 76 → program stores it in num.
